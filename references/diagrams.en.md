# Diagrams

kami's drawing capability. **We don't reimplement 13 diagram types.** We ship three that are actually useful inside long-doc, portfolio, and slides: architecture, flowchart, quadrant. All of them wear kami's skin (parchment + ink-blue + warm grays). No second design system.

Every diagram is a **self-contained HTML + inline SVG**. No Mermaid, no JS, no build step. Browse them as standalone pages, or copy the `<svg>...</svg>` block into a long-doc `<figure>` to embed.

## 1. Selection

| Showing… | Use | Template |
|---|---|---|
| System components + connections | **Architecture** | `assets/diagrams/architecture.html` |
| Decision branches, "if A then B else C" | **Flowchart** | `assets/diagrams/flowchart.html` |
| Two-axis positioning / prioritization | **Quadrant** | `assets/diagrams/quadrant.html` |

Not on the list:
- **Time / stages**: use the built-in timeline component in `resume.html` or `one-pager.html`. Don't reinvent.
- **Compare two things**: use a table. A three-column table beats any diagram of a binary contrast.
- **Hierarchy / nested lists**: a nested markdown `ul` is enough.
- **One box with a label**: delete the box, write the sentence.

### The question before drawing

> Would a well-written paragraph teach the reader less than this diagram?

If "no", don't draw. Diagrams add signal to hierarchy, direction, and magnitude. They don't decorate prose.

## 2. Complexity budget

**Target density: 4/10**. Enough to be technically complete, not so dense the reader needs a guide.

- Nodes > 9 -> this is two diagrams, not one
- Two nodes that always travel together -> they're one node
- A line whose meaning is obvious from layout -> remove the line
- 5 nodes in ink-blue -> you haven't decided what's focal

**Focal rule**: 1-2 focal elements per diagram (`#1B365D` stroke + `#EEF2F7` fill). Everything else goes neutral. Focal signal comes from contrast, not count.

## 3. Embedding in long-doc / portfolio

### Standalone preview

Open `assets/diagrams/architecture.html` (or `flowchart.html`, `quadrant.html`) directly. Each file is a complete HTML page with title, SVG, and caption.

### Embed in a kami document

Extract **only the `<svg>...</svg>` block** from the template (leave the frame / h1 / eyebrow behind). Drop it into a long-doc `<figure>`:

```html
<figure>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 960 460" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <!-- svg content copied from architecture.html -->
  </svg>
  <figcaption>Figure 1. {{Short editorial caption in serif.}}</figcaption>
</figure>
```

`long-doc.html` already styles `figure` and `figcaption`. No extra CSS required.

### Editing nodes / text

Edit the `<text>` and `<rect>` values directly. Rules:

- **All coordinates, widths, and gaps must be divisible by 4.** This is the anti-AI-slop floor. Break it once and the diagram starts looking "close enough".
- Node widths: 128 / 144 / 160 (three tiers, don't add more). Small diagrams (viewBox width < 360) may compress to 2 tiers, but still keep it 2 — don't tailor each node.
- Node heights: 32 (pill) / 64 (standard)
- Font sizes: 7 (small mono label) / 9 (sublabel mono) / 12 (name sans)
- **Arrow endpoints land exactly on node edges**: start `(box.x + box.w, box.y + box.h/2)`, end `(box.x, box.y + box.h/2)`, not "close enough". A 10px gap is visible to the eye.
- **SVG top padding**: the `y` in `<text y="…">` is the baseline. `y` must be ≥ font-size × 1.2, otherwise the tops of capital letters extend above the viewBox and get clipped (classic symptom: "TOOLS" renders as "TOULS"). Either pad the viewBox at the top or move `y` into the safe zone.
- **Loop arc control points**: for a four-cardinal-node ring, each arc is a Q-curve whose control point sits at the **outer intersection of the two adjacent tangent axes**, not at a node corner. Example for PLAN (top) → ACT (right): start = PLAN's right-edge midpoint, end = ACT's top-edge midpoint, control = `(ACT.x + ACT.w/2, PLAN.y + PLAN.h/2)`. This gives a pure horizontal tangent at departure and pure vertical at arrival, reading as a clean quarter-circle. Control at the node corner produces a squashed arc.
- **Closed loops need a dashed framing ring**: four directed arcs alone force the reader to mentally connect them into a loop. A dashed circle centered on the visual center (radius slightly larger than center-to-inner-edge distance) makes the loop immediately readable. Draw the ring below the nodes; solid node fills mask where the ring crosses each node; the ring shows only between nodes.
- **Chevron arrows, not filled triangles**: use `<path d="M2 1 L8 5 L2 9" fill="none" stroke=... stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"/>`. A filled triangle reads as technical UI; an open two-stroke chevron reads as editorial schematic. kami defaults to chevron. **WeasyPrint does not support `<marker orient="auto">`**: all markers render at 0° (pointing right). The fix is to skip `<marker>` and draw each arrowhead as a manual chevron `<path>` with hardcoded direction (see production.en.md #15).

### Color token map

Shared tokens across the three diagrams, mapping directly to kami's design system:

| SVG role | kami token | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | `--parchment` | `#f5f4ed` |
| Standard node fill | (white) | `#ffffff` |
| Standard node stroke | `--near-black` | `#141413` |
| Store node fill | near-black 5% | `rgba(20,20,19,0.05)` |
| Store node stroke | `--olive` | `#5e5d59` |
| Cloud node fill | near-black 3% | `rgba(20,20,19,0.03)` |
| Cloud node stroke | near-black 30% | `rgba(20,20,19,0.30)` |
| External node fill | olive 8% | `rgba(94,93,89,0.08)` |
| External node stroke | `--stone` | `#87867f` |
| **Focal fill** | `--brand-tint` | `#EEF2F7` |
| **Focal stroke** | `--brand` | `#1B365D` |
| Standard arrow | `--olive` | `#5e5d59` |
| Focal arrow | `--brand` | `#1B365D` |
| Primary text | `--near-black` | `#141413` |
| Secondary text | `--olive` | `#5e5d59` |
| Tertiary text / small mono label | `--stone` | `#87867f` |

Don't add a fourth state ("warning amber", "success green"). kami has one accent.

## 4. AI-slop anti-patterns

Scan for these when drawing or reviewing:

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Dark mode + cyan / purple glow | Cheap "technical" signifier with no design decision |
| All nodes identical size | Destroys hierarchy |
| JetBrains Mono as the universal "dev" font | Mono is for technical content (ports, URLs, fields). Names go in sans. |
| Legend floating inside the diagram area | Collides with nodes |
| Arrow labels without a masking rect | Line bleeds through the text |
| Vertical `writing-mode` text on arrows | Unreadable |
| Three equal-width summary cards as a default | Template feel. Vary widths. |
| `box-shadow` on anything | kami only permits ring / whisper |
| `rounded-2xl` / border-radius above 10px | Max 6-10px. Beyond, it starts to look like App Store chrome. |
| Ink Blue on every "important" node | Focal rule is 1-2, not a signaling system |
| Emoji icons 🚀 📊 💡 | Disaster |
| Gradient backgrounds | kami forbids them |
| Focal color contradicts the caption's claim | Caption says "Simple **core**", but the ACT node is painted ink-blue — two focals competing. Focal color must match the word emphasized (`<span class="hl">`) in the caption |
| Cycle diagram with a dashed ring AND four directed arcs | Same loop drawn twice; reader thinks there are two flows |
| SVG text clipped at the viewBox top | `text` y is the baseline; cap letters extend above y=0. Pad the top by font-size × 1.2 or adjust the viewBox |
| 5-10px gap between arrow endpoint and node edge | Reads as "arrow floating in space". Anchor endpoints to exact `box.x / box.x+w / box.y / box.y+h` |
| Per-node custom widths within one diagram | Four steps at widths 60 / 76 / 80 / 100 feel hand-patched. Small diagram: 2 tiers. Large: 3 tiers. That's the full budget |
| Porting an external diagram with one accent color per node type (purple/amber/green/red) | kami has one accent. When adapting external diagrams, migrate the focal to whichever element the caption's `<span class="hl">` emphasizes; concentrate color there, keep all other nodes neutral |
| Ring diagram: every node is a single word, center is empty | Four labeled boxes looping with no anchor. Either add a subtitle to each node or place one line of text at the center (exit condition, LOC count, etc.). Pick one. |

## 5. Common pairings

### Technical white paper
- Architecture (system overview) + built-in timeline (from long-doc)
- One architecture diagram per chapter, maximum. If you want two, the chapter is covering two topics and should split.

### Portfolio project page
- Quadrant (competitive positioning) or architecture (the layer you owned)
- **Not every project needs a diagram.** Only when the diagram says something prose can't.

### One-pager
- Quadrant (priority) or flowchart (decision path)
- One diagram only. If you're tempted to add a second, kill the weaker one.

### Resume
- **No diagrams.** Resume real-estate costs more than diagrams. Rare exception: a URL to a portfolio diagram when showing system-level capability.

### Slides
- One diagram per slide, max. The diagram is the body. Text is caption, not a sidebar.

## 6. Build / preview

```bash
python3 scripts/build.py diagram-architecture
python3 scripts/build.py diagram-flowchart
python3 scripts/build.py diagram-quadrant

# or all
python3 scripts/build.py
```

Or just open `assets/diagrams/*.html` in a browser.

## 7. Credit

This capability is inspired by Cathryn Lavery's [diagram-design](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design) (a Claude Code skill with 13 editorial diagram types). kami borrowed the **approach** (inline SVG, semantic tokens, complexity budget, anti-slop table). Not the full catalog. Thirteen types would bloat kami; three are enough for every document type kami serves.
